        and 12 months internships that meet the required 540 guided
        learning hours. Our flexible approach aims to transition people

        world of work.

        THE ACCESSIBLE WORKSHOP Work Experience In 2021, as part of our programme, we launched The Accessible Workshop, which covers a wide range of woodworking and practical skills. It teaches people how to plan and manage projects, as well as how to market and sell. Each individual works to clear and structured plans, with each project treated as a commissioned piece of work. The income generated is then reinvested back into the enterprise, or is used to aid charitable partners that we work with. From basic safety awareness around the home, through to repairing, creating, up-cycling, and developing employment skills; The Accessible Workshop creates realistic progression pathways</p>
    <br>
    <a href="https://talkback-uk.com/our-services/employability/"> Talkback | Supported Employment</a>
    <p>The aim of Supported Employment is to work with individuals to support them into successful paid employment of their choice. We want autistic individuals and people with a learning disability to feel valued and respected in the workplace and to have the same opportunities as everyone else. 

        This is achieved by giving both the individual and the employer realistic and ongoing support mechanisms within the workplace. 
        
        The process of getting someone into employment demands initial high levels of intervention and support, with gradual lessening of support as the person enters the workplace and increases in confidence and skill. 
        The three steps of our programme: 
        1. Getting Work Ready
        - Confidence and team building
        - Professional working relationships and how to build them
        - Job Skills understanding
        - Employer visits to learn more about work environment and the skills needed to work
        - Travel training and how to use a range of public transport
        - Independent living skills, including cooking, managing a household and budgeting
        2. Finding and securing a role
        - Supported internships
        - Career counselling and support services
        - Job club and skill development (including creating an impactful CV)
        - Creating and developing a LinkedIn profile
        - Effective job search and targeted applications
        - Interview and presentation techniques
        3. Ongoing work support
        - Ongoing support and guidance from our job coaches
        - Helping people to navigate their roles
        - Building confidence
        - Help with accommodations and modifications
        - Fostering positive relationships with co-workers
